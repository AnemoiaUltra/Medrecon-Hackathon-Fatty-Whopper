If you encounter any trouble trying to run the website, contact me (Rijad Aljovic, 061 653 603) so that i can bring my laptop (on which the site was made) to show you how it runs in real time, also Medical Portal was one of the initial names we intended to give this website hence the folder name being medical-portal, however that idea was scraped. In the public folder, the logo.png is the logo which can be seen in the top left corner of our website.
